# Motor-Vehicle-collisions-Crashes-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing motor vehicle collision data from New York, Chicago, and Austin to identify accident trends, assess safety measures, and predict high-risk areas. By leveraging multiple datasets, advanced ETL processes, and interactive visualizations, the project aims to support enhanced urban traffic safety strategies for city planners and public safety officials.

## Key Features

Comprehensive Data Analysis: Analyzed motor vehicle collision data across New York, Chicago, and Austin, assessing accident trends and predicting high-risk areas.

Advanced ETL Implementation: Utilized Talend to establish and automate robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes for managing large datasets sourced from city open data portals.

Dimensional Modeling: Developed and implemented dimensional data models in ER Studio to ensure efficient and structured data management.

Data Integration and Management: Leveraged Azure SQL Server, MySQL, and SQL Server to stage and integrate large volumes of data for a comprehensive analysis of urban traffic safety.

Interactive Visualizations: Created dynamic, user-friendly dashboards using Tableau and Power BI, offering critical insights into accident distributions, peak times, and contributing conditions, aiding in data-driven decision-making for public safety improvements.
